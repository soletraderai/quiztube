- Update name to QuizzTube. This will be the new name of the platform
- When a user is logged in they are not to be shown the log in or register links and only shown an Avatar icon which will take them to their profile page.
- Add Google Material Icon Library
- Move navbar to sidebar with a dark background and fun animations to collapse and expand
- Sidebar nav items to have icons assigned to each item, need to keep the neobrutalism design
- Collapsed sidebar is icons only
- Ajax search for live results when searching. Search is to show 5 options for autocomplete underneath the search term. Also update library results on live search.
- Need to ensure that we only accept YouTube URLs for now
- Add in a cleaner centralized route management system

**Finalising Phase 2**
- What features are still yet to be completed? Why were they not completed? What needs to happen for these to be completed? Define what success looks like.

**Deployment Strategy**
- Digital Ocean for Hosting
- Supabase for Auth and Database
- Stripe for Payments
- Github for Repo

Need to ensure that we have a clear deployment strategy in place for our workflow. The plan is to continue to work locally whilst pushing updates to the main repo, how will this work? What is the best way forward?

**Home Page**
- Define content for Home Page
- Lots of animation, must be fun. Heavy use of GSAP. Push the boundaries of design for neobrutilism 
- Test section? With 1 question?
- Is it possible to have an animated demo of how the website works?
